# NarutoQuiz

## Project Purpose

In this project, I was tasked with developing a responsive quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Whenever answers were not correct, the background would turn red indicating a negative answer. Correct answers resulted in a green background. Additionally, in my first implementation of local storage, users were allowed to save their highscores along with their initials on the page.
